# Welcome to the Malloy Quickstart

This repository contains a notebook file that walks you through the basics of the Malloy language.

To run the notebook directly in your browser, press the `.` key from Github (or visit this repo from [github.dev](https://github.dev/malloydata/quickstart)) and install the Malloy Extension when prompted. For instructions on how to install extensions, see the [VSCode help page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).

Once you've installed the Malloy extension, navigate to the [Quickstart Notebook](quickstart.malloynb) and dive in!

After completing the quickstart, continue your Malloy journey by:
