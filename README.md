# Welcome to the Malloy Quickstart

This repository contains a notebook file that walks you through the basics of the Malloy language.

We recommend running the notebook directly in your browser in the web-based VSCode experience provided by Github. You can launch this either by visiting this repository from [github.dev](https://github.dev/malloydata/quickstart), or by pressing the `.` key on your keyboard from Github. When prompted by the notification in the bottom right, install the Malloy Extension. Once you've installed the Malloy extension, navigate to the [Quickstart Notebook](quickstart.malloynb) and dive in!

After completing the quickstart, continue your Malloy journey by:

- Exploring the [documentation](https://malloydata.github.io/documentation/)
- Exploring more sophisticated analysis and data models in our [Patterns repo](https://github.com/malloydata/patterns)
- Joining the [Malloy community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/malloy-community/shared_invite/zt-1t32mufpy-THwP1o1ADJVkd3o2L2zaZw)
